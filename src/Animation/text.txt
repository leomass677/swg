Here’s a clear explanation of each part of your Framer Motion animation system so you can confidently use it in your React projects:

---

## 🧠 Framer Motion Animation System Explained

### 1. `fadeIn(y, delay, duration)`
**Purpose:**  
Fades in the element while sliding it vertically (usually upward).

**Parameters:**
- `y`: How far the element starts offset vertically (positive = down, negative = up)
- `delay`: Time before animation starts
- `duration`: How long the animation lasts

**Use Case:**  
Great for text blocks, headings, or any content that should gently appear as you scroll.

---

### 2. `zoomIn(scale, delay, duration)`
**Purpose:**  
Starts the element slightly smaller and zooms it into full size while fading in.

**Parameters:**
- `scale`: Starting scale (e.g. 0.95 = 95% size)
- `delay`: Time before animation starts
- `duration`: How long the animation lasts

**Use Case:**  
Perfect for buttons, icons, or hero images that need a pop-in effect.

---

### 3. `slideLeft(x, delay, duration)`
**Purpose:**  
Slides the element in horizontally from the left (or right if `x` is negative) while fading in.

**Parameters:**
- `x`: Horizontal offset (positive = from right, negative = from left)
- `delay`: Time before animation starts
- `duration`: How long the animation lasts

**Use Case:**  
Ideal for sidebars, feature lists, or step-by-step content.

---

### 4. `staggerContainer(stagger, delay)`
**Purpose:**  
Applies a staggered animation to all children inside a container.

**Parameters:**
- `stagger`: Time between each child’s animation
- `delay`: Time before the first child starts

**Use Case:**  
Use this for lists, grids, or groups of elements that should animate in sequence.

---

### 5. `MotionBox` Component
**Purpose:**  
A reusable wrapper that applies any of the above animations to its children.

**Props:**
- `type`: `"fade"`, `"zoom"`, `"slide"`, or `"stagger"`
- `delay`, `duration`: Timing controls
- `y`, `x`, `scale`: Position/size controls depending on animation type
- `hover`: Enables scale-up on hover
- `stagger`: Enables staggered animation for children

**Use Case:**  
Wrap any element in `MotionBox` to animate it on scroll or hover.

---

### 6. `hover` Prop
**Purpose:**  
Adds a hover effect that scales the element slightly when the mouse is over it.

**Use Case:**  
Use on buttons, cards, or interactive elements to make them feel responsive.

          Hover Me
        </button>

        <div className="space-y-4">
